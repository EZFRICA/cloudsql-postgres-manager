# Pseudocode Directory

## Purpose

This directory contains pseudocode examples and implementation guides for extending the Cloud SQL IAM User Permission Manager. These examples demonstrate how to customize the default behavior to meet specific business requirements.

## Structure

```

## Philosophy

The Cloud SQL Manager is designed with **extensibility** in mind:

1. **Default Implementation**: Provides basic, working functionality out of the box
2. **Customization Points**: Clear interfaces for extending behavior
3. **Pseudocode Examples**: Reference implementations for common use cases
4. **Best Practices**: Guidelines for safe and effective customization

## When to Use Pseudocode

- **Business Rules**: Company-specific permission policies
- **Audit Requirements**: Compliance and logging needs
- **Integration**: Hooks for external systems
- **Performance**: Optimizations for specific environments
- **Security**: Additional validation and checks

## Integration Approach

### Option 1: Replace Default Implementation
```python
# In your custom class
def revoke_object_permissions(self, cursor, username: str, schema_name: str) -> bool:
    # Your custom logic here
    return self.revoke_object_permissions_custom(cursor, username, schema_name)
```

### Option 2: Extend with Decorators
```python
# Add custom logic around the default implementation
def revoke_object_permissions(self, cursor, username: str, schema_name: str) -> bool:
    # Pre-processing
    if not self.validate_revocation_conditions(username):
        return False
    
    # Default implementation
    result = super().revoke_object_permissions(cursor, username, schema_name)
    
    # Post-processing
    self.log_revocation_action(username, result)
    return result
```

### Option 3: Plugin Architecture
```python
# Use a plugin system for different revocation strategies
def revoke_object_permissions(self, cursor, username: str, schema_name: str) -> bool:
    strategy = self.get_revocation_strategy(username)
    return strategy.execute(cursor, username, schema_name)
```

## Available Examples

### revoke_object_permissions.md
- **Selective Permission Revocation**: Choose which permissions to revoke
- **Role-Based Strategies**: Different approaches for different user types
- **Audit Trail**: Logging and tracking of actions
- **Conditional Logic**: Business rule-based revocations

### config_examples.md
- **Environment-Specific Configurations**: Production, staging, development
- **Business Logic Scenarios**: Role-based, time-based, compliance requirements
- **Advanced Configurations**: Conditional logic, external system integration
- **Best Practices**: Guidelines for different use cases

### example_usage.py
- **Working Python Example**: Demonstrates custom implementation
- **Role-Based Logic**: Shows how to implement different strategies
- **Integration Guide**: Step-by-step implementation instructions

## Creating Your Own Pseudocode

1. **Identify the Customization Point**: Which function to extend
2. **Define Requirements**: What your custom logic should do
3. **Consider Constraints**: Cloud SQL limitations, performance, security
4. **Write Pseudocode**: Clear, readable implementation examples
5. **Test Thoroughly**: Validate in your environment
6. **Document**: Explain the logic and usage

## Best Practices

### Code Quality
- Use clear, descriptive function names
- Include comprehensive error handling
- Add detailed logging for debugging
- Follow Python conventions

### Security
- Validate all inputs
- Use parameterized queries
- Implement proper access controls
- Log security-relevant actions

### Performance
- Minimize database round trips
- Use efficient SQL queries
- Consider transaction boundaries
- Profile your custom logic

### Maintainability
- Write self-documenting code
- Include usage examples
- Document assumptions and limitations
- Version your customizations

## Getting Help

- **Code Review**: Have peers review your customizations
- **Testing**: Test in staging before production
- **Documentation**: Keep your pseudocode updated
- **Community**: Share useful patterns with the team

## Future Additions

This directory will grow with additional examples:
- Custom permission granting strategies
- Advanced user validation logic
- Security enhancement examples

**Remember**: Pseudocode is meant to be a starting point. Adapt and modify based on your specific needs while maintaining the core principles of safety, performance, and maintainability.
